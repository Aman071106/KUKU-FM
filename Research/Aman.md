# AI-Powered Thumbnail Generation

## Challenge Overview
Develop an AI-driven thumbnail generation system that takes a **title name** and a **concept note** as inputs, then produces multiple (e.g., five) visually distinct thumbnail designs. Each thumbnail should reflect the **core idea and style** implied by the user's concept note while offering variation in **layout, color schemes, and artistic direction**.

### **Key Challenges**
1. **Text-to-Visual Interpretation:** Understanding the concept note to guide the thumbnail design and mood.
2. **Style Variation:** Generating multiple thumbnails with **distinct designs, layouts, and color palettes**.
3. **Aesthetic Consistency:** Ensuring each thumbnail remains visually **coherent and aligned** with the title and concept.
4. **Scalability:** Handling **millions of requests efficiently** while keeping costs low.
5. **Localized Support:** Supporting **Hindi and South Indian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada)**.
6. **Title Logo Generation:** AI must generate a **title logo** and automatically place it onto the image.

## Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Input ‚Üí Title & Concept Note**  
   - Backend receives **title and concept note** in Hindi or regional languages.
   - NLP model **extracts key themes** (colors, style, visual elements).

2Ô∏è‚É£ **AI Generates 5 Unique Thumbnails**  
   - Stable Diffusion + ControlNet generates **5 visually distinct** thumbnails per request.
   - Ensures **style diversity** in layout, color, and composition.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Title Logo AI Embeds Text**  
   - OpenCV processes and **places the title automatically** for the best visibility.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Post-Processing Enhances Output**  
   - **Pillow** applies final adjustments (resizing, sharpening, branding).
   - Image is **compressed and optimized** for fast delivery.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Storage & Delivery**  
   - Thumbnails stored on **AWS S3**.
   - **Cloudflare CDN** ensures fast loading.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **User Selection & Feedback**  
   - Users choose their preferred thumbnail, improving future AI recommendations.
